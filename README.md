# AddPersonInputFields
An mvc application that displays a list of people. 
On top of the list is a link that takes the user to a page that allows the user to enter multiple people. 
When that page loads, it displays a row of textboxes for the user to enter the person fields (first name, lastname and age) with a button on top that says "Add Row". When the button is clicked, another row of textboxes for people fields is added. 
Beneath those textboxes, there is a submit button which, when clicked, adds all those people to the database and then redirects the user back to the home page.
